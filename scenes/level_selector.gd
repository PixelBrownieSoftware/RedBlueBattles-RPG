#TODO: There will be about 8 bosses in the base game
#3 of them are initally accessible, you need to unlock the others via EXP
#The max level might be about 50
#All the bosses are maybe around the 30 - 50 range

#Surrounding each boss is a mixture of battle groups sharing a theme
#I plan this game to be fucking brutal, although it won't punish death
